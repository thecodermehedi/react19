# What's coming in react version 19 ?


In This Simple **React + Vite + Tailwind + Bun** Project I practiced some of the latest features of **react 19** by installing <code>react@experimental</code> and <code>react-dom@experimental</code> versions. I have also included the old way of doing things and also the new way of doing things in react version 19. At the time of this writing in **7th April 2024** react version 19 isn't released yet. The stable version of react now is **react@18.2.0**
